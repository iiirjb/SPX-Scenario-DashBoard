# SPX-Scenario-DashBoard

A GICs scenario builder for understanding SPX future price outcomes using varied assumptions for forward EPS growth and PE multiples. Assume 3 year EPS compounded growth and a current PE 3 years forward.

## Description

This project analyzes S&P 500 (SPX) future price scenarios by modeling different assumptions around forward EPS (Earnings Per Share) growth rates and PE (Price-to-Earnings) multiples. It helps investors and analysts understand potential SPX outcomes under different market conditions and assumptions.
